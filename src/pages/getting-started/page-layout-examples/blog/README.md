# Blog layout

## Usage

Simply copy the files into your project, or one of the [example applications](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples), and import and use the `Dashboard` component.

You can easily customize the layout to suit your design, and substitute an alternative markdown renderer.

## Files

| File  | Purpose  |
|---    |---       |
| `Blog.js` | Main file. Customize the layout by adding grid components and changing breakpoints. |
| `Markdown.js` | Markdown renderer. It enhances markdown-to-jsx output to use the Typography |component. You can customize it or substitute an alternative.
| `blog-post.x.md` | Sample blog posts to demonstrate the renderer.|
