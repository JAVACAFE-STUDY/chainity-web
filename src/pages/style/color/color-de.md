# Color

<p class="description">Convey meaning through color. Out of the box you get access to all colors in the Material Design spec.</p>

The Material Design [color system](https://material.io/design/color/) can be used to create a color theme that reflects your brand or style.

## Color system

### Important Terms

#### "Palette"

A palette is a collection of colors, i.e. hues and their shades. Material-UI provides all colors from the Material Design guidelines. [This color palette](#color-palette) have been designed to work harmoniously with each other.

#### "Hue" & "Shade"

A single color within the palette is made up of a hue such as "red", and shade, such as "500". "red 50" is the lightest shade of red (*pink!*), while "red 900" is the darkest. In addition, most hues come with "accent" shades, prefixed with an `A`.

### Examples

The Material Design color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.

For instance, you can refer to complementary primary and accent colors (for example 'red 500' & 'purple A200'), like so:

```js
import purple from '@material-ui/core/colors/purple';
import red from '@material-ui/core/colors/red';

const primary = red[500]; // #F44336
const accent = purple['A200']; // #E040FB
const accent = purple.A200; // #E040FB (alternative method)
```

### Color palette

Given a *HUE* (red, pink, etc.) and a *SHADE* (500, 600, etc.) you can import the color like this:

```jsx
import HUE from '@material-ui/core/colors/HUE';

const color = HUE[SHADE];
```

{{"demo": "pages/style/color/Color.js", "hideHeader": true}}

## Color tool

To test a [material.io/design/color](https://material.io/design/color/) color scheme with the Material-UI documentation, simply select colors using the palette and sliders below. Alternatively, you can enter hex values in the Primary and Secondary text fields.

{{"demo": "pages/style/color/ColorTool.js", "hideHeader": true}}

The output shown in the color sample can be pasted directly into a [`createMuiTheme()`](/customization/themes/#createmuitheme-options-theme) function (to be used with [`MuiThemeProvider`](/customization/themes/#theme-provider)):

```jsx
import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import purple from '@material-ui/core/colors/purple';

const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: purple,
    secondary: {
      main: '#f44336',
    },
  },
});
```

Only the `main` shades need be provided (unless you wish to further customize `light`, `dark` or `contrastText`), as the other colors will be calculated by `createMuiTheme()`, as described in the [Theme customization](/customization/themes/#palette) section.

If you are using the default primary and / or secondary shades then by providing the color object, `createMuiTheme()` will use the appropriate shades from the material color for main, light and dark.

### Official color tool

The Material Design team has also built an awesome palette configuration tool: [material.io/tools/color](https://material.io/tools/color/). This can help you create a color palette for your UI, as well as measure the accessibility level of any color combination.

</a>

The output can be fed into `createMuiTheme()` function:

```jsx
import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      light: '#757ce8',
      main: '#3f50b5',
      dark: '#002884',
      contrastText: '#fff',
    },
    secondary: {
      light: '#ff7961',
      main: '#f44336',
      dark: '#ba000d',
      contrastText: '#000',
    },
  },
});
```
